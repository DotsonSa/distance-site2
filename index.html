        <p class="txt">
  There are plenty of reasons to get into marathon or distance, really though it's best if you are interested. The sights are pretty nice, but you could just hike. Just getting into for exercise is slightly overkill because running 5k and 10ks is good enough. I had run for an hour or two before, and found that I liked it a bit too much. I could bike for two hours and then run one then finish up by biking home, which is another two hours. Doing that showed me how much fun it is just biking and running. I honestly don't know my exact reasons for getting into it besides I liked more than other things.

        <p class="txt">
Running will give you some nice legs and good health comes out of any exercise. An odd plus that comes out of running is the ego boost. Finishing races, hard runs, and the times you look back and see everything you ran past that pushes a smile out when your legs are jelly makes you feel good later. There is also the runners high, to me it's an incredible focus that lets me forget that I am running, chase some thoughts down and figure out anything. Completing the list is seeing nice views, it doesn't have to be too nice because I'm tired and relaxing in the sun shine is good.

        <h2 class="title">Cool People</h2>
        <p class="txt">
Cool people are easy to find while running. During races or even runs, they can help by telling about their experiences and how they solved them. There is a lot of odd stuff that can be done for running, ice baths, and a good amount of stretching that magically works, finding out about them are difficult on your own. They can also give out tips on routines or places they run to make running easier. Other times cool people are just nice, friendly, and probably a little odd.

        <h2 class="title">Races</h2>
        <p class="txt">
        Any race that is run includes the feeling of becoming a superhuman, the race implants an idea that you can do any and everything. During the course it dies down as people pass you who didn't go out too strong. This feeling happens in all races, for marathons there are other obstacles. Dehydration, calorie intake, and pacing are important are very different than other races. In marathons it's okay to walk a bit, maybe a steep uphill to keep some energy for the easy downhill. Water isn't so hard, just make sure to stay hydrated throughout the week and drink to thrist the day before, so just drink a cup or two every pit stop or more. As for calories, this is a difficult subject to discuss without knowing metabolism and such, for myself I ate terribly and hit the wall pretty hard. I didn't carbo-load and ate little during the race. Things to eat would be carb and suger foods, so pretty much the food they have at the tents.

        <h2 class="title">Starting Out</h2>
        <p class="txt">
  Transitioning into a marathon runner from a general runner requires some displine that comes from running a few years or maybe just a person who can run without worrying too much. One general accomplishment in order to run a marathon is running a 20 miler. It tells you how you feel when running distance and most of what you need to know. Pacing should be looked at as well as comfort, because an important part of distance running is lubing up since chafing hurts. Starting out at the very begining is different, really only adding how to enter running and then following the transition. To start off, just run for some minutes and let your body hurt, stretch a bit then do the same the next day or day after and up your distance to maybe a mile or so. I really can't say much about it other than a little basic tips. If there was one thing I wouldn't be worried about too much is some problems, my arches hurt so I rolled a tennis ball over every night I ran and hoped it'd get better then it turns out one way of stretching ended the pains. Other times it could be terrible like tendonitis, a good tip is don't overdo training.

        <h2 class="title">About the Kid Who Made This</h2>
        <p class="txt">
  I am the author and designer of this site, it was made more for practice than education about running. It was my first project and looks to be in a redesign phase until I make my portfolio and put that into permanent redesign. I'm an 18 year old kid who decided not to goto school and pursue a career in different computer careers with my end goal being a job in IT. With this site I want to accomplish a begining of a freelance web designer career and show this off to people I know so I can say I have been doing actual work in the year I didn't do much. This design is very basic and expect changes with colors, fonts, and other odds and ends that will be experimented on. The pictures on this site have been taken without permission and the sites they came from will be sourced. The pictures used in the Why, Benefits, and Cool People sections where all from a race report which is located <a class="link" href="http://www.mitchleblanc.com/2014/08/2014-fat-dog-120-race-report/">here</a>.
